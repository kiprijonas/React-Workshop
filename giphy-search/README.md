# React Giphy Search
A little test which if done correctly results into React Giphy Search.

### Prerequisites
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Running
From the project directory install the dependencies and run the app:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
You should focus on passing correct props to <Components> and fixing the Redux part.
A new tab should open in your favorite browser with an almost empty app except for a searchbar that literally does nothing.

### What you should do
There are three files that are commented and needs fixes:
```sh
 src/components/SearchBar.js
 src/containers/App.js
 src/reducers/modal.js
```
If done correctly, you should be able to type in 'cats' into searchbar and get loaded with favorite gifs of the internet.

If you get stuck somewhere or need any explanation, don't hesitate to ask!
